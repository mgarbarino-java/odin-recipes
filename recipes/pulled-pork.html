    <p>When I travel to the Carolinas I make to a habit to stop and try some pulled pork. I wanted to try and make it so I could have it any time that I wanted to.
        This is a recipe that I came up with with a little trial and error. Having some friends that are from the area helps with getting everything right.
        This recipe is for a croke pot so I can make this anytime of the year.
